1) The Idea
The core approach involves training a YOLOv11 model to detect players and referees in soccer match footage.
Then, a pretrained ReID model is used to extract player-specific features (e.g., clothing color, appearance embedding) from each frame.
DeepSORT tracking assigns local IDs per view. Cosine similarity between feature embeddings across views is used to match players and assign consistent global IDs.

2) Challenges
Initially, understanding and implementing YOLO and ReID models took time, as this was my first experience with them. 
Learning how to apply and integrate these models was the most time-consuming part.

Once that was in place, I encountered issues with inconsistent ID assignments and false-positive bounding boxes. 
I addressed this by applying a confidence threshold (≥ 0.5) to reduce noise.

The biggest challenge was achieving stable cross-view global ID mapping — some players were still mismatched or unmatched, 
especially when detection failed or appearances were similar.

3) Is This Task Fully Done?
No — not yet. While the current system tracks players and assigns reasonably consistent global IDs across two views, it’s not yet robust enough for real-world deployment.

I believe the solution can be improved by using the ball's position as a universal anchor.
This would allow more reliable matching using both spatial and appearance information.
While I haven’t implemented that yet due to lack of experience in spatial modeling, I plan to explore it further using LLMs and tutorials to learn quickly.
